coredump2packages - Extract package information from a coredump.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'coredump2packages' COREDUMP [--repos WILDCARD...] [--log FILENAME] [--fields FIELD...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool matches a coredump to packages from the provided repositories.

OPTIONS
-------

--repos WILDCARD...::
  Names of repositories that should be searched. Multiple wildcards or
  repository names can be specified. Default value is '*' (search all
  repositories, including the disabled).

--log FILENAME::
  Store debugging information to a specified file. When 'stdout' or
  'stderr' is provided as FILENAME, the debugging output is redirected
  to standard (erorr) output.

--md-cache-dir DIR::
  Directory to store repository metadata cache, which speeds up
  repository metadata initialization. If the provided directory does
  not exist, it is created.

--fields FIELD...::
  Specifies the output of the tool. The order of provided fields is
  used for coredump2packages output. The fields are separated by an
  empty line in the output. An empty field output is indicated by a
  single line containing the '-' character. Default value is
  'installable_packages'.

Fields
~~~~~~

'packages'::
  Prints all packages (name-version-release) that are possiby
  referenced from the coredump. The list includes multiple versions of
  debuginfo packages if they matches a build_id and multiple versions
  of binary packages that correspond to debuginfo packages.

'components'::
  Prints all components that are possibly referenced from the
  coredump.

'program_packages'::
  Prints a list of packages that contain the binary referenced by the
  coredump with the matching build_id.

'program_components'::
  Prints a list of components which package contains the binary
  referenced by the coredump via build_id.

'installable_packages'::
  Prints a list of packages that are referenced from the coredump and
  that are installable. This means there are no conflicts between them
  or their dependencies.

'installable_components'::
  Prints a list of components covering the installable packages.

'installable_program_package'::
  Prints a package containing the binary referenced from the coredump.

'installable_program_component'::
  Prints a component that contains the binary referenced from the
  coredump.

'full_installable_packages'::
  Prints an installable full set of packages that can be used to setup
  an environment for coredump analysis via chroot GDB.

'missing_build_ids'::
  Prints a list of build ids from the coredump without corresponding
  debuginfo package found in provided repositories. Every line
  contains a build id and a path to binary.

'missing_packages'::
  Prints a list of debuginfo packages that were referenced from the
  coredump, but no binary was found in corresponding binary packages.
  In other words, the debugging symbols are available, but the binary
  is not. Every line contains a debuginfo package name-version-release
  and a path to binary that was not found in packages.
